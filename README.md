<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

###

### I love low level programming. I code primarily in C and C++. I’m currently working on [Archimedes Game Engine](https://github.com/AGH-Code-Industry/archimedes) and [my very fast minimal chat server](https://github.com/piti83/blank-chat).

### Personally I really don't like GitHub and soon i might migrate all my repos to a different git hosting platform. If I do so, i will put a link to all the repos here.

### It's worth remembering that GitHub (Microsoft) uses our repositories to train their AI models. At the same time they claim that these LLM's are going to replace majority of us. What an extraordinarily ethical move Microsoft! 

### Anyway! Feel free to use my repos in your projects and consider contributing if you like them ;)
